        We are an approachable way to elevate your novel. We believe fiction is
        a tool to access indistinct parts of our souls to find what truly lies
        within us. This tool allows us to find worlds beyond reality, emotions
        deeper than daily life, and come out with deeper beliefs. Our role is to
        journey with you through your discovery and refining processes. So your
        messages, plots, characters, and imagination can reach the people that
        need it.
