There are two types of people in the world, those that like pumpkin, and those that don’t. My husband doesn’t.

If you’re like us, and have both pumpkin lovers, and haters in your fam, this is what we make to keep everyone happy. This bread is a delicious compromise between the two. It has great texture and flavor, but the pumpkin is very subtle.

The best part is how forgiving this recipe is. It lends so well to gluten free and vegan options. And the nuts and chocolate chips are optional, thought highly recommended. 

Ingredients

- 3 ⅓ cups flour (gluten free cup to cup works great)
- ½ tsp baking powder 
- 2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp nutmeg
- ⅔ cup oil (grapeseed recommended)
- 2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 4 eggs (flax eggs work great)
- 1 15 oz can pumpkin
- ⅔ cup water
- 1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
- 1 cup chocolate chips (optional, check for gf and vegan in needed)

DIRECTIONS 

Grease loaf pans - two normal or 8 little 5in x 3in (recommended for best bake and cutest presentation) Move the rack to the middle position in the oven and preheat it to 350 degrees fahrenheit. 

In a medium bowl whisk together the dry ingredients (first five) and set aside. In a separate bowl add the brown sugar and oil and combine well. Add vanilla and 1 egg at a time, mixing thoroughly with each addition. (Do this even with flax eggs, just eyeball it.) stir in pumpkin. Add dry mixture, alternating with the water, in 3 additions until just smooth. Do not over beat. Fold in nuts and chocolate chips and divide between prepared pans. 

Bake in a preheated oven. For the little loaves check at 25 - 30 minutes in. If your oven runs cool it may take up to 40 or 45 min. For the normal size loaves check at 45 minutes, but it could take up to 60. Keep an eye on them the first time so you know your oven.
