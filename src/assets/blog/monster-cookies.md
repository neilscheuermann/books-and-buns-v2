We can’t get enough of delicious, easy snacks. Especially during a Nanowrimo session, or any work-as-much-as-you-can mode. Here we have a recipe that fills two needs at once! As it correlates so well with the fall season all together.

Halloween is such a magical time of year to me. Celebrating life and death and the magic in-between. Dress-ups and spooks. 

But, the very best part? The traditions! Make these cookies the day after Halloween, they are perfectly titled Monster Cookies (plus you can use all the m&m’s from your trick-or-treating loot)

These cookies temper some of the pure sugar with a little bit of protein and fiber, viola! Fun cookie tradition! 

I hope you like these as much as we do! 

Ingredients

- ½ lb. butter (room temp)
- 1 ½ lb non-natural peanut butter (I prefer smooth/creamy)
- 1 lb. (about 2 1/4c) brown sugar (I prefer dark)
- 2 cups white sugar
- 6 eggs
- 1 ½ tsp. vanilla
- 1 ½ tsp. honey
- 4 tsp. baking soda
- 9 cups oats (I use quick oats)
- ½ lb. chocolate chips (I prefer semi-sweet…also I never measure and am sure I dump in A LOT more than this)
- 1 bag plain M & M’s
 
Directions:

- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
- In a large bowl mix butter, peanut butter, and sugars. 
- Add eggs and mix. 
- Add vanilla, honey, and baking soda and mix.
- When all combined, gently fold in oats and chocolate chips.
 
- Scoop 1/4 cup of dough into a cookie sheet (I use silicone pads for easy removal) and flatten slightly.
- Bake for 7-8 minutes (cookies will still look doughy)
- Immediately upon removal from the oven stick 6 M & M's in each cookie.
- Allow cookies to cool on a cookie sheet 5-10 minutes before moving to a cooling rack to cool completely.

These taste even better the next day and are freezer friendly.
